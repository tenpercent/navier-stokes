In order to build you need CMake (>=2.6.0) and GNU Make

How to build (simple):

1. $> cd build
2. $> cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=<DEBUG | RELEASE>
3. $> make

How to build (advanced):
1. $> cd build
2. $> ccmake ..
3. set different options
4. $> make

How to run:

1. $> ./build/bin/PDESolver

Results of current run are stored in file "results.csv" in directory where the program is run. Might want to collect them in separate directory, some time.
